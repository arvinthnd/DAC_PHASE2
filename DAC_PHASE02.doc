Project:
        Air Quality Analysis


Problem Statement:
        The project aims to analyze and visualize air quality data from monitoring stations in
        Tamil Nadu. The objective is to gain insights into air pollution trends, identify areas
        with high pollution levels, and develop a predictive model to estimate RSPM/PM10 levels
        based on SO2 and NO2 levels. This project involves defining objectives, designing the
        analysis approach, selecting visualization techniques, and creating a predictive model
        using Python and relevant libraries.


Approach for making design:

    Data Mining:
        Data mining or Knowledge Discovery (KD) is used to read and analyze large
        datasets and then finding/extracting patterns from the data. It is used for predicting
        the future trends or forecast patterns over a period. Data mining algorithms are usually
        based on wellknown mathematical algorithms and techniques. There are two types of data 
        mining learning algorithms: 1) Supervised algorithms and 2) Unsupervised algorithms.
        We are going to make optimal use of these to train our machine learning model for better
        prediction. The dataset is provided in the Government website.

    Unsupervised learning algorithm:
        The Unsupervised algorithm is the process in which the training dataset contains only the
        input set and not the corresponding target vectors. The main criterion is to find groups
        or patterns of similar examples within the dataset, called as clustering.

    Supervised learning algorithm:
        The Supervised algorithm is the process in which the training data comprises of both the
        training and the corresponding output target vectors. In this project, a supervised
        learning algorithm called Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been used for training,
        validation and testing the dataset. In addition, to the ANN, a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
        model has been used for comparing the performance against the ANN. The below section introduces
        the processes of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).

Conclusion:
    Thus the design making phase has been implemented successfully.
